Check on this points if they are working as expected.

Looks like I can’t open your repo directly from here (the GitHub fetch failed). But no worries — I can guide you on **exact areas to check in your project files** so that your Tailwind styles work properly on Vercel.

Here’s where to look and what to fix:

---

### 1. **Check `tailwind.config.js`**

Open this file in your repo root. Make sure it has the **correct content paths**:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

❌ Common mistake: forgetting `"./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts}"` → results in empty CSS after build.

---

### 2. **Check `postcss.config.js`**

You need this file in the root of your project. Inside, confirm it looks like:

```js
// postcss.config.js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

❌ Common mistake: missing `postcss.config.js`, so Vite doesn’t process Tailwind at build time.

---

### 3. **Check Your `main.js` (or `main.ts`)**

Make sure Tailwind CSS is actually imported:

```js
// src/main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

// Import Tailwind
import './assets/tailwind.css'

createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

❌ If you only import it in one component, styles may not apply globally.

---

### 4. **Check `tailwind.css` File**

In `src/assets/tailwind.css`, you should have:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

❌ Missing this means Tailwind won’t generate any styles.

---

### 5. **Force Clean Build on Vercel**

Sometimes Vercel caches incorrectly. Do this:

* Go to Vercel → Deployments → **Redeploy**
* Or push a dummy commit (`git commit --allow-empty -m "redeploy" && git push`)
